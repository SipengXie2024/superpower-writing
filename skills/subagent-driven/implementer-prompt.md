# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Plan Reference

    Plan file: .writing/plan.md
    Task section: [exact section header, e.g., "### Task 3: Recovery modes"]
    Design file: .writing/design.md (if exists)

    The task description above was extracted from the plan by the orchestrator.
    If anything seems ambiguous or incomplete, read the original plan section
    at the path above to get the full context. The plan is the source of truth.

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Planning Directory

    Your planning directory is: {AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}
    (e.g., .writing/agents/implementer/)

    **Do NOT create per-task directories** like `implementer-task-1/`. Use ONE directory per role.

    **MANDATORY — Planning Rules (do this BEFORE any implementation work):**

    1. Use the Read tool to read this file:
       `{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/planning-foundation/templates/agent-context.md`
       This contains the 6 planning rules you MUST follow. Replace `{AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}` with your planning dir path.

    2. Check if `{AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}/findings.md` and `progress.md` already exist:
       - **If they exist:** Read them first to understand context from previous tasks, then APPEND to them.
       - **If they don't exist:** Initialize by copying the templates:
         - Read `{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/planning-foundation/templates/findings.md` → write to `{AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}/findings.md`
         - Read `{CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/planning-foundation/templates/progress.md` → write to `{AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}/progress.md`

    **You MUST have `findings.md` and `progress.md` in your planning dir before writing any prose. Do NOT create other files like `notes.md` — only use `findings.md` and `progress.md`.**

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Implement exactly what the task specifies
    2. Write tests (following TDD if task says to)
    3. Verify implementation works
    4. Commit your work
    5. Self-review (see below)
    6. Update planning dir with final status
    7. Report back

    **2-Action Rule:** After every 2 read/search/explore operations, save key findings to `{AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}/findings.md`. Don't wait until the end — record discoveries, decisions, and surprises as you go.

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Completeness:**
    - Did I fully implement everything in the spec?
    - Did I miss any requirements?
    - Are there edge cases I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the manuscript clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I only build what was requested?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Testing:**
    - Do tests actually verify behavior (not just mock behavior)?
    - Did I follow TDD if required?
    - Are tests comprehensive?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - What you implemented
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns
    - Planning dir location: {AGENT_PLANNING_DIR}
```
