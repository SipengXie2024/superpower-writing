# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests -> Present options -> Execute choice -> Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
# Auto-detect and run project's test suite
TEST_CMD=$(${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-test-command.sh)
eval "$TEST_CMD"
```

**If tests fail:**
```
Tests failing (<N> failures). Must fix before completing:

[Show failures]

Cannot proceed with merge/PR until tests pass.
```

Stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

**If tests pass:** Continue to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/detect-base-branch.sh
```

Or ask: "This branch split from main - is that correct?"

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

**Don't add explanation** - keep options concise.

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally

```bash
# Switch to base branch
git checkout <base-branch>

# Pull latest
git pull

# Merge feature branch
git merge <feature-branch>

# Verify tests on merged result
<test command>

# If tests pass
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR

```bash
# Push branch
git push -u origin <feature-branch>

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
<2-3 bullets of what changed>

## Test Plan
- [ ] <verification steps>
EOF
)"
```

Then: Keep worktree (may need for PR revisions)

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is

Report: "Keeping branch <name>. Worktree preserved at <path>."

**Don't cleanup worktree.**

#### Option 4: Discard

**Confirm first:**
```
This will permanently delete:
- Branch <name>
- All commits: <commit-list>
- Worktree at <path>

Type 'discard' to confirm.
```

Wait for exact confirmation.

If confirmed:
```bash
git checkout <base-branch>
git branch -D <feature-branch>
```

Then: Cleanup worktree (Step 5)

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

**For Options 1 and 4:**

Check if in worktree:
```bash
git worktree list | grep $(git branch --show-current)
```

If yes:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

**For Option 3:** Keep worktree.

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | yes | - | - | yes |
| 2. Create PR | - | yes | yes | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | yes | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | yes (force) |

## Common Mistakes

**Skipping test verification**
- **Problem:** Merge broken code, create failing PR
- **Fix:** Always verify tests before offering options

**Open-ended questions**
- **Problem:** "What should I do next?" -> ambiguous
- **Fix:** Present exactly 4 structured options

**Automatic worktree cleanup**
- **Problem:** Remove worktree when might need it (Option 2, 3)
- **Fix:** Only cleanup for Options 1 and 4

**No confirmation for discard**
- **Problem:** Accidentally delete work
- **Fix:** Require typed "discard" confirmation

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

**Always:**
- Verify tests before offering options
- Present exactly 4 options
- Get typed confirmation for Option 4
- Clean up worktree for Options 1 & 4 only

### Step 6: Archive Reminder and Persist Findings

After cleanup, if `.writing/findings.md` or `.writing/progress.md` has meaningful content:

1. **Read** `.writing/findings.md`
2. **Prompt the user explicitly** via `AskUserQuestion`:

```text
Implementation is finished. Before we move on, do you want me to archive this session?

1. Yes — run /archive now (recommended)
2. Not now — remind me next time work resumes
3. Skip archiving for this task
```

3. If the user chooses **1**: invoke `superpower-writing:archiving`
4. If the user chooses **2**:
   - Add a clear reminder line at the top of `.writing/progress.md`, for example:
     `ARCHIVE REMINDER: This task is complete. Run /archive before starting unrelated work.`
   - Report that the reminder was saved
5. If the user chooses **3**: continue without archiving

If the user does **not** archive and `.writing/findings.md` still has meaningful content:

6. **Ask the user** if they want to persist key findings to Claude's memory system anyway
7. If yes: write the valuable, reusable insights (patterns discovered, architectural decisions, debugging lessons) to the project's auto memory files (`~/.claude/projects/.../memory/`)
8. Skip session-specific details (task status, temporary workarounds) — only persist knowledge that helps future sessions

**This step is main-agent only.** Subagents do not persist findings to memory.

**Default bias:** Prefer `/archive` over ad-hoc memory writes when a meaningful task has just finished.

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **superpower-writing:executing-plans** (Step 5) - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **superpower-writing:git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
