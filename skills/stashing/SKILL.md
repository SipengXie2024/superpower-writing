# Stashing Unfinished Work

Pause the active project in `.writing/` without claiming it is done.

**Core principle:** `archive = done`, `stash = paused`. The target is the active project (design, plan, findings, progress), not "the session."

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the stashing skill to pause this work safely."

## When to Use

Use this skill when:
- current work is unfinished but you need to switch projects
- you are blocked on external input, dependency, or review
- you want to keep `.writing/` clean without losing working context
- the task should be resumable later

Do **not** use this skill for completed work. Use `superpower-writing:archiving` instead.

## The Process

### Step 1: Check stash-worthiness and completion guard

Run the planning state check:
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-writing-state.sh
```

Act on the result:
- `missing` or `empty` → warn the user there is nothing meaningful to stash. Stop.
- `complete` → do **not** stash. Redirect to `superpower-writing:archiving`.
- `active` → proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine stash name

Derive a short stash name from the active task, then ask the user to confirm or modify it.

Generate a unique directory name:
```bash
mkdir -p .writing/stash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/unique-filename.sh .writing/stash "<name>" ""
```
The empty extension `""` produces a directory-compatible name without `.md` suffix. Create the directory:
```bash
mkdir -p "<returned-path>"
```

### Step 3: Save active project into stash directory

Save all active project files using the shared snapshot script:

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/snapshot-save.sh "<returned-path>"
```

Then write a `snapshot.md` with metadata for quick resume context:

```markdown
# Stash: <name>
**Date:** YYYY-MM-DD
**Status:** paused

## Current Goal
<!-- 1-2 lines -->

## Where We Stopped
<!-- concrete current status -->

## Next Steps
<!-- immediate next 3-5 actions -->

## Open Questions / Blockers
<!-- what is missing, blocked, or uncertain -->

## Important Files / Branches
<!-- key files, branch names -->
```

### Step 4: Reset active state

```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/writing-reset.sh
```
This removes `design.md`, `plan.md`, `progress.md`, `findings.md`, and `agents/`, then recreates clean templates. `archive/` and `stash/` are preserved.

Report: "Stashed to .writing/stash/<name>/"

### Step 5: Resume protocol

When resuming from a stash later:

1. **Check active work first:**
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/check-writing-state.sh
```
   - `missing` or `empty` → safe to proceed
   - `active` or `complete` → warn the user and offer options:
     1. Stash active work first, then resume
     2. Archive active work first, then resume
     3. Overwrite active work (destructive)
   - Do not overwrite without explicit confirmation.

2. **List available stashes:**
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/stash-list.sh
```
3. If multiple exist, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user choose one
4. **Restore files from stash directory to `.writing/` root:**
```bash
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/stash-restore.sh ".writing/stash/<selected>"
```
5. Read `snapshot.md` from the stash directory for resume context
6. **Perform stale-findings check** before continuing:
   - compare stash assumptions against current repo state
   - run `git diff --stat`
   - quickly verify referenced files, paths, and branch still exist
   - mark findings as:
     - `still valid`
     - `needs refresh`
     - `obsolete`
7. Explicitly report any stale or questionable findings before execution resumes
8. If drift is large, recommend switching to `superpower-writing:brainstorming` or `superpower-writing:writing-plans` instead of blindly continuing

**Legacy stash format:** If the selected stash is a single `.md` file (old format) instead of a directory, read it and restore context into `.writing/findings.md` and `.writing/progress.md` as before.

## Resume Output Format

When resuming, summarize in this format:

```text
Stash resumed: <name>

Findings freshness check:
- still valid: <items>
- needs refresh: <items>
- obsolete: <items>

Recommended next step:
- <single best next action>
```

## Key Principles

- `stash` is for paused unfinished work, not completed work
- stash preserves the entire active project (design, plan, findings, progress, agents)
- stale-findings check is mandatory on resume
- if resume reveals major drift, suggest re-planning instead of blindly continuing
